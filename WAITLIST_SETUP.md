# Waitlist Setup Instructions

## 1. Create the Waitlist Table in Supabase

Go to your Supabase project SQL Editor and run this:

```sql
-- Create waitlist table
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS waitlist (
  id UUID DEFAULT gen_random_uuid() PRIMARY KEY,
  email TEXT NOT NULL UNIQUE,
  created_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NOW(),
  source TEXT DEFAULT 'landing_page',
  metadata JSONB DEFAULT '{}'::jsonb
);

-- Add index for faster lookups
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS waitlist_email_idx ON waitlist(email);
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS waitlist_created_at_idx ON waitlist(created_at DESC);

-- Enable Row Level Security
ALTER TABLE waitlist ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

-- Allow anyone to insert (for signup)
CREATE POLICY "Allow public signups" ON waitlist
  FOR INSERT
  TO anon
  WITH CHECK (true);

-- Only authenticated users can view
CREATE POLICY "Only admins can view waitlist" ON waitlist
  FOR SELECT
  TO authenticated
  USING (true);
```
