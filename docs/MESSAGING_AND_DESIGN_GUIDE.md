# Sherlock AI - Messaging & Design Guide
## Single Source of Truth for All Copy, Design, and UX Decisions

**Purpose:** This document ensures every word, color, and interaction aligns with our brand and converts visitors into users.

---

## The Oneliner Formula Applied to Sherlock AI

Every piece of copy must follow this structure:

### 1. Problem (The Hook)
**Single Resonant Problem:** E-commerce stores are losing thousands of dollars every month to invisible revenue leaks they can't detect.

**Agitate the Problem:**
- Store owners know revenue is leaking but have ZERO visibility into where or how much
- They're making blind decisions, optimizing the wrong things
- Every day, money walks out the door unnoticed
- Traditional analytics show WHAT happened, not WHY it's costing money

**Put the Hero in a Hole:**
> "Your store lost $23,400 last month. You had no idea. While you're obsessing over ad spend, your checkout is bleeding customers. You can't fix what you can't see."

---

### 2. Product (The Specific Solution)
**Extremely Specific Plan:**

Sherlock AI connects to your Shopify store, analyzes 47 data points in real-time, and shows you exactly which revenue leaks are costing you money—with step-by-step fixes you can implement in 15-45 minutes.

**The Clear Framework (3 Steps):**
1. **Connect your store** (60 seconds) - Shopify, WooCommerce, or BigCommerce
2. **Sherlock analyzes** - Cart abandonment, conversion rates, mobile UX, checkout friction
3. **Get ranked fixes** - Prioritized by revenue impact with exact implementation guides

**Answer Objections:**
- ❌ Not another analytics dashboard you'll ignore
- ❌ No data science degree required
- ❌ No expensive consultants
- ✅ Fixes take 15-45 minutes, not weeks
- ✅ See results in your next sales report
- ✅ Works with your existing tools

---

### 3. Result (The Happy Ever After)
**The "So That" Statement:**

So that you can recover tens of thousands in lost revenue every month, without hiring consultants or spending more on ads.

**Specific Vision of Success:**
- Stop wondering why your conversion rate is stuck at 2%
- Know exactly which 3 fixes will recover the most revenue
- Implement changes this week, see money back next week
- Focus on growth instead of constantly plugging leaks
- Never leave money on the table again

**The Ultimate Outcome:**
> "Store owners who use Sherlock AI recover an average of $32,500/month in revenue they didn't know they were losing. Not by spending more—by fixing what's already broken."

## Tone & Voice Guidelines

### ✅ DO Use:
- Direct, confident language
- Specific numbers (not "lots" or "many")
- Active voice ("Sherlock finds" not "leaks are found")
- Problem-first approach (start with pain)
- Professional terminology (revenue leaks, conversion rate, AOV)
- Action verbs (Stop, Start, Recover, Implement)

### ❌ DON'T Use:
- Emojis in body copy (ok in UI sparingly)
- Buzzwords (synergy, leverage, disrupt)
- Vague claims ("improve your business")
- Hype language (AMAZING! INCREDIBLE!)
- Technical jargon without explanation
- Passive voice
- Questions as headlines

### Examples:

**Good:**
> "Your store lost $23,400 last month. Sherlock AI finds exactly where and how to fix it."

**Bad:**
> "Are you wondering if your store could be performing better? Our amazing AI-powered solution leverages cutting-edge technology to synergize your data!"
